          And the year 2020 had been a reflection of the same. <br> In here I would share my experiences,

                <h1>A Look Back at 2020...</h1>
                <p>
                    Discussed and talked about a thousand times, yet a part of it remains just as challenging for all of us to speak about, every single time.
                    Yes, 2020 was like a storm, silent and calm in the beginning and then coming at us, unexpectedly, hitting us all right in the face.
                    But as Andrew Mathews says in his book <i>Follow Your Heart</i>, <q>We learn our biggest lessons when things get rough.</q>
                    Well, I guess that's what 2020 was, a lesson learnt the hard way. <br><br>
                    Like most of you, my year too started off at a good note, celebrating with my family and friends, going to the World Book Fair at Pragati Maidan, New Delhi, (I got a huge collection of books at an unbelievable bargain!),
                    preparing for and attending our college's fest - Taarangana, the most exciting two days of this entire year probably.
                    In March I turned 20. Nothing of an adventure, really, I had my semester exams then so it was all about the Instagram wishes you get and cutting cake with my loved ones.
                    And by this time, India too, like the rest of the world, had it's number of corona cases increasing.
                    And who even took it that seriously then. We all were infact so dearly happy with the fact (I was atleast) that we won't have to go to college and sit in those lectures for a month or so.
                    Playing Ludo after dinner was a routine at home. That is a vicious game, I tell you. Everybody used to get so competitive and at times the game went beyond to just be a game. It was an actual issue on some days.
                    God! that was crazy yet a lot of fun. Took us all some time to accept that it is just a game <i>(Lol!).</i>
                    I was much determined to flip my life around in the beginning of the year, by setting up goals to eat healthy, exercise daily, maintain a proper morning and night routine, practice a hobby... the list goes on. And I did do all these things for a certain period of time. 
                    I started drawing doodle art, gardening, yoga and cooking <i>(I can make chapatis all round and tasty, Rishta ready? Lol! NO!)</i> and a lot more. 
                    Earlier this year, I did a course on Web Development which got me my first internship at <i>Raahee- a mental health startup</i> led by my favourite seniors at college. My happiness had no bounds.
                    There wasn't any stipend for it but that wasn't the important part even. The idea of being mentored by my seniors was more exciting to me. And I must say that throughout the internship I gained confidence, built real things, experimented, did mistakes and learnt from them.
                    This experience would always remain special to me. It was amidst this internship, I applied for a part time instructor at a company <i>(no, not WhiteHat Jr.)</i>. Yeah right! Most of you criticize how it is unfair to teach kids coding at the age when they should be playing outdoor etc. Well, I don't totally agree with this.
                    I got selected as an instructor for Game Development (and later App Development) and on my very first day I was teaching a kid from Australia. And at the end of it, when he was so happy with the project he had built, I knew I had done my job right. <span id="continue">...</span><button onclick="readMorefunc()" id="btn">Continue Reading</button><span id="more"><br> Ever since, I have taught more than 100 students and it enthralls me 
                    when they build their own games/ apps and show it to me and we work on projects outside the curriculum. Some of the students would even share about what they learnt in school, the states they live in and their culture. Teaching coding to kids gave me a new perspective to it. We as, college students find it difficult to adapt to the concepts of loops, functions, 
                    classes, etc, especially when we aren't familiar with it. Think about how a kid would see these things, you have to match up to their level, make them relate to it by giving examples or designing games yourself. They astonish me by their consistency and their eagerness to learn about everything they can see on the screen.
                    For them, this is not their career, they take it as a hobby and just flare at it, so effortlessly. Learning has to be fun else it is nothing but memorizing lessons for exams. And this doesn't work in real life.
                    I carried this idea forward when I myself got stuck in the cycle of stressing over learning new things rather than enjoying the process.
                    <br><br>
                    There came a point where things got overwhelming I wanted to go out, meet people, exchange hugs and just be there, be out there again, free to explore and seek.
                    And that's when it struck me how granted I had taken my life for, all these years. Never, even in my wildest nightmares, had I imagined witnessing a pandemic. That wasn't on the list.
                    Thinking of even going to the park for a walk seemed to be a luxury. People would put up pictures wearing masks and PPO kits saying 'going for first grocery in 2 months'. It was at this time, I started to lose it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Remember the time when we used to say, <i>I wish I had more time!</i>? Well, 2020 gave us <i>all the time</i>. We literally had all the time to do whatever we wanted to, to redesign that room, to clear up that cupboard, to learn new skills, to work on that project idea and every other possible thing.
                    But you know what the problem was? We had <i>too much time at hand</i>. As if, a person who isn't able to eat a two square meal has been gifted a lavish life with all the luxuries. Poor he! Doesn't even know how to utilize them.
                    This thought was maddening to me. I always did wish for more time and when I did get that, I didn't know how to use it! And this lasted for a good period of time. I would watch movies or shows to distract me, thinking I am taking a time off and I will come back with better constructive solutions.
                    But little did I know that I was just fooling myself because the more I procrastinated, the more stressed I got. And add to it the college internship season. I knew I wasn't enough skilled or maybe I just lacked self- confidence. But in those vulnerable times, even the most trivial things would pinch. 
                    And here, I was drowning. What did I do? I got back up! That's what we do right, when we fall down!?
                    <br><br>
                    Counting on my blessings, focusing on <i>ME</i>, taking baby steps everyday and giving myself time to redirect my thoughts guided me towards the right path. With the right help and support I was able to work on my sleep cycles, focussed on my priorities, and began believing in the fact that <i>I CAN!</i>
                    This is the best thing anyone can do to themselves, believing that they can and everything <i>IS</i> possible. We've all heard of this <q>Charity begins at home.</q> You are your first and foremost home.
                    Be kind to yourself, improve yourself and never listen to those who say <strike><i>Accept the person you are</i></strike>, rather <em>Change the person you are for the good!</em> Don't be comfortable with your unprogressive, lazy and dull self saying 'This is just who I've become.' Because if you cannot be a better you, 
                    you will never be good enough for others. <i>Call your friends even if they don't, text them, talk to your mother, discuss work with your father, spend time with your siblings, mend the broken friendships if it still means something to you, take your chances, sing, dance and be happy!</i> Put your first step forward, 
                    be it in friendships, career or relationships, you never know what wonders can happen. Believe in magic! Being an engineering student, I do, because science too, is magic, just like all other art forms.
                    <br><br>
                    I cannot guarantee that 2021 will be a better year, but if we carry our lessons of 2020 forward, it sure won't be bad enough. And this time, atleast we are all prepared.
